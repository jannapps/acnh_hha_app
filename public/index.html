        <h3>Welcome!</h3>
        <p><b>Please read our terms of service:</b></p>
        <p>Right now, this site is still in-development, so the terms of service haven't been ironed out quite yet. Basically, just don't be a jerk (i.e. don't attempt to break the site).</p>
        <br>
        <p>Some cool things you can do:</p>
        <ul class="rule-list">
            <li>Create new user!</li>
            <li>Logout, login, close the browser and reload the page without losing your session!</li>
            <li>Do intricate searches to find any furniture you could want!</li>
            <li>Add furniture to your house, or to a wishlist!</li>
            <li>Furniture added to your house is automatically stored in your collection page!</li>
            <li>The score for your house is calculated as items are added to rooms! View <a href=/myhouse'>My House</a> to check your total!</li>
            <li>Ruby generates the markup for search filters so I didn't have to type it all!</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>Some issues to keep in mind:</p>
        <ul class="rule-list">
            <li>You can't delete your account yet. Once you're here, you're here forever.</li>
            <li>You can't remove items from lists.</li>
            <li>A search that is too general will cause the page to freeze as a result of too many results. Pagination is needed in the future.</li>
            <li>There are certain search filter options that will cause a database failure due to unescaped characters, ex. "child's room"</li>
            <li>SQL Injection and session spoofing are absolutely possible. Just don't do it please.</li>
            <li>Passwords are stored in plain-text, as this is just a demonstration. A real production site would encrypt the passwords.</li>
            <li>Some aspects of the score calculation algorithm are unimplemented. These would require dramatically increasing the complexity of the application and its database, so they're left unimplemented for demonstration purposes.</li>
            <li>The interface is... a work in progress. I wrote all of the HTML and CSS myself by hand. Please be kind.</li>
        </ul>
