## To Do
* create css for search filter box
* create button that submits search filter box inputs with POST
* write code for doing the db query with the received fields
* create empty default option for all search terms that will leave that term unused in the query
* do input validation for the one text box

## Ideas
* populate the select boxes for search terms with erb db query that finds all possible colors/concepts/sets/categories/sizes? 
  * this would make the runtime for each operation much longer, maybe just do this every now and then?
